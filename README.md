# Compare speed between PySpark and Pandas
 
PySpark is the Python API written in python to support Apache Spark, a distributed framework that can handle Big Data analysis, while Pandas is the most common package when people deal with dataframe in Python.

If I have a 8GB csv, what should I do? Using PySpark or Pandas? I am gonna compare the performance of two.
